									<h2 class="major">User and CRM Interfaces - Prototype</h2>
									<p>
										In this project, I was responsible for designing the user interface and CRM interface prototype 
										for the project proposal. Our goal was to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that 
										effectively communicated the proposal to the client. I used a combination of wireframing tools 
										and design software to create a visually appealing and functional design, and gathered user feedback 
										to ensure that the design met their needs and expectations. The resulting interface was easy to navigate
										and understand, and effectively communicated the project proposal to the user. Through this process, I 
										gained valuable experience in gathering user feedback and using wireframing tools and design software to
										create successful interfaces. As a member of the team, my contribution was to design the user interface 
										and CRM interface prototype, which played a key role in the success of the project.

									<h2 class="major">Softweb Tech Solutions - Logo Design</h2>
									<p>
										In this project, I designed a logo for SoftWeb Tech Solutions, a company that provides a 
										variety of services including mobile application development, software development, web 
										development, and IT consultation services. The goal of the logo was to effectively communicate 
										the company's services and brand identity. To create the logo, I used Adobe Photoshop and 
										Illustrator to combine elements and create a professional and modern design. The result of 
										the design process was a logo that effectively communicates the company's services and brand 
										identity. Through this process, I learned the importance of conducting research on current 
										design trends and the company's target audience. My contribution to the team was the design 
										of the logo, as well as conducting research on current design trends and the company's target audience to ensure that the design aligns with their vision for the brand.

									<h2 class="major">Julio Supermart - Logo Design</h2>
									<p>The purpose of this work is to design a logo for Julio's Supermart, a 
										grocery store in Cebu City. The objective of the project is to create a modern, 
										professional logo that represents the store's offerings of fresh and preserved 
										food and household items. I began by conducting research on the store's history 
										and values, gathering information from the owner, Mr. Ponce, and looking at other 
										logos in the grocery industry. I then experimented with different design elements, 
										including colors, fonts, and imagery, until I arrived at the final design, which is 
										a blue shopping cart with the store's name inside. Through this project, I learned 
										the importance of thorough research and experimentation in the design process. As a 
										member of the design team at SoftWeb Tech Solutions, my contribution to this project 
										was to create the logo for Julio's Supermart. I worked closely with the owner to ensure 
										that the final design met his vision and provided feedback to the rest of the team 
										throughout the process.

									<h2 class="major">Rizal Genealogy - Infographic</h2>
									<p>
										The purpose of this infographic is to provide a visual representation of Rizal's family tree, 
										along with information about their social status in the 19th century. The infographic includes 
										photos of Rizal's parents to provide context and make it more engaging. To create the infographic, 
										I researched Rizal's family and their social status, organized the information in a clear and 
										concise way, and used Canva to create a visual representation. The final product is an informative 
										and visually appealing infographic that displays Rizal's genealogy and the social status of his family. 
										Through this project, I gained knowledge about Rizal's family and their social status, and gained 
										experience in creating infographics and presenting information visually. I also learned from any mistakes 
										I made and used that knowledge to improve the final product.
